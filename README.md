# Redux Toolkit Sample Code

Welcome to the Redux Toolkit Sample Code repository! This project serves as a demonstration of best practices and usage patterns for implementing state management in a React application using [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

## Introduction

Redux Toolkit is a powerful toolset that simplifies and streamlines the development of Redux applications. This sample code showcases the integration of Redux Toolkit in a React application, highlighting key features such as `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`, and more.

## Getting Started

To run the sample code locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/redux-toolkit-sample.git`

2.  Change into the project directory:
    `cd redux-toolkit-sample`

3.  Install dependencies:
    `npm install`

4.  Start the development server:
    `npm start`

This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

### Counter Feature

- Increment button to modify a counter value.
- Utilizes Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` for reducer and action creation.

### Async Data Feature

- Fetch and display data from a [fake API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).
- Utilizes Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk` for handling asynchronous data fetching.
